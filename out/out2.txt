Ranking the party ideas in terms of decreasing cost would be:

1. DIY Photo Booth - This idea requires a camera or smartphone, a tripod or stand, a backdrop (which can be made out of streamers, balloons, or fabric), props (e.g. hats, glasses, signs), and lighting (e.g. string lights or lamp). The cost of these materials can vary, but in general, this idea is less expensive than the other two options.
2. DIY Mini Succulent Garden - This idea requires small plant pots, succulent plants, potting soil, decorative rocks or pebbles, and miniature figurines or decorations (optional). The cost can add up depending on the number of guests and the quality of materials chosen.
3. Personalized T-Shirt Making Party - This idea requires plain t-shirts, fabric markers or iron-on transfers, design templates (optional), and an iron (if using iron-on transfers). The cost of the materials can add up depending on the number of guests and the quality of the t-shirts and markers used.###
